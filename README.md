# Jammer-Simulator-for-LEO-GEO-Constellation
An evolving project whose core is an interactive Tkinter GUI simulating a single satellite ↔ ground station link. It is designed to: (1) visualise LEO vs GEO orbital geometry, (2) expose and demystify a dynamic link budget, and (3) act as an interference scenarios (jamming), counter‑measures and large–scale constellation resilience analysis
