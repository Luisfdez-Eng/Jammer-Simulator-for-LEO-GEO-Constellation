# üõ∞Ô∏è Educational LEO / GEO Satellite Link SimulCurrent status: **Scenario 1 Complete, Scenario 2 Research Phase**

### ‚úÖ **Scenario 1: LEO Fundamental Validation** *(Completed)*tor & Progressive Jamming Analysis Framework

An evolving project whose core is an interactive Tkinter GUI simulating a single satellite ‚Üî ground station link. It is designed to: (1) visualise LEO vs GEO orbital geometry, (2) expose and demystify a dynamic link budget, and (3) act as an interference scenarios (jamming), counter‚Äëmeasures and large‚Äìscale constellation resilience analysis.

## üîç Overview
The repository currently ships with one self‚Äëcontained script `JammerSimulator.py` implementing:
- Parameter loading (JSON) and a thin separation between core state and GUI.
- Simplified 2D rendering of Earth, an animated LEO satellite and a draggable GEO slot.
- Fundamental calculations: slant range, elevation, free space path loss (FSPL), propagation latency, C/N0 and C/N.
- Real‚Äëtime metrics panel plus CSV/XLSX historical export.

On top of this base we will iteratively build a modular framework covering operational and hostile phenomena in contemporary satellite systems (mega‚Äëconstellations, hybrid links, coordinated attacks, adaptive counter‚Äëmeasures, environmental degradation, resilience strategies, etc.).

## üéØ Core Educational Objectives
1. Make the geometric & energy gap between LEO and GEO tangible (distance, FSPL, latency, future Doppler).
2. Provide link budget transparency: every term visible and traceable.
3. Layer complexity gradually: start with ‚Äúideal vacuum‚Äù (no extra losses, no interference); add factors incrementally with clear rationale.
4. Encourage rapid experimentation: editable parameters + clean exports.
5. Prepare a substrate for advanced evolutions (adaptive jamming, severe weather, hybrid redundancy, systemic resilience).

- **Data Export**: Structured CSV/XLSX with professional formatting

Current implementation includes realistic Earth rotation, multi-body synchronization, and advanced time control. Future extensions will factor out jamming modules (`interference.py`, `jammers.py`, `countermeasures.py`) to maintain educational clarity.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Current Usage Flow

2. Select LEO or GEO mode.
3. Adjust EIRP, G/T, frequency, bandwidth, and loss parameters.
4. **Time Control Options:**
   - **Automatic Mode**: Start animation with real-time orbital dynamics
   - **Manual Mode**: Enable fine control sliders for precise positioning
   - **Sensitivity**: Adjust time scale (0.1x-5.0x) for detailed analysis
5. **Advanced Features:**

## ‚ö° Quick Install
Minimum: Python 3.10+ (Tkinter usually bundled). Optional: `openpyxl` for XLSX export.
```
pip install openpyxl
python JammerSimulator.py
```
On Windows, install the official Python distribution if Tkinter is missing.

## üóÉÔ∏è Parameters (JSON)
`SimulatorParameters.json` centralises altitudes, EIRP, G/T and base values. Upcoming loss, noise and interference parameters will extend it in a backward compatible manner.

## üß≠ Design Principles
- Numerical transparency (show before over‚Äëabstracting).
- Simplicity before maximal physical fidelity (e.g. aesthetic orbit scaling while keeping physics correct).
- Gradual layering: every new term (loss, noise, interference) accompanied by rationale & formula.
- Structured export for spreadsheets / scientific notebooks.

## üöÄ Planned Extensibility (Technical Summary)
- Doppler: derived from orbital velocity & radial component ‚Üí compensation illustration.
- Loss model: flexible dB summation with per‚Äëcomponent toggles & typical range annotations.
- Noise: decomposition T_sys = T_ant + T_rx + (‚àë losses √ó equivalent temperature).
- Interference: configurable spectral density, multiple sources aggregated linearly.
- Advanced metrics: Eb/N0, margin, Shannon capacity, spectral utilisation.
- Coverage: per‚Äësatellite area and constellation sizing for a minimum elevation.
- Hybrid failover: automatic link selection based on latency, margin, interference.

## üì§ Data Export (Enhanced)

- No atmospheric, rain or miscellaneous losses applied (all 0 dB by default).
- No interference or channel jitter modelling yet.
- Limited input validation (ranges / types) presently.
